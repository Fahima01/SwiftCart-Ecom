1. What is the difference between null and undefined?
ans: Null: when the value is empty and has no value. Sometimes it keeps as intentionally. In boolean contexts, null is considered "falsy", meaning it's false.
undefined: it shows when no return statement is found. Example: missing arguments, properties, or function return.

2. What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()?
ans: The JavaScript map() function is used to transform an array into a new array by applying a function to each element.
while forEach() is used to simply iterate over an array to perform actions or side effects.

3. What is the difference between == and ===?
ans: == checks if two values are equal and will convert types if needed.
=== checks if two values are equal and are of the same type too.

4.  What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data?
ans: async/await makes working with asynchronous code, like fetching API data. It lets you wait for the data to arrive before moving to the next step,
avoiding messy callbacks and making the code look like normal synchronous code.

5. Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block).
ans: Scope in JavaScript determines where a variable is accessible. Global scope means the variable can be used anywhere in the code.
Function scope means the variable is only accessible inside the function it’s defined in. Block scope (using let or const) means the
variable is only accessible inside the block {} where it’s defined.
